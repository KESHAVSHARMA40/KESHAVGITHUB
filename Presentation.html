    <h1>Re-defined</h1>
    <p id="div">Re-Defined is non-profit started in January, 2022 with the goal of empowering people from marginalized communities especially BIPOC community and international students. The main ways in which we hope to empower the youth is via provision of access to education, opportunities and necessary resources. Our education comes in the form of workshops which cater to topics raging from social issues like menstrual and sexual education, awareness around sexual abuse, climate and sustainability to skill/career based topics like entrepreneurship, leadership, marketing and financial literacy more to also topics such as health literary and more. We couple these with provisions of access to opportunities in the form of events, mentorship programs, networking, fellowship opportunities and community engagement and provision for access to resources such as those of menstrual products, school supplies and more
        Through this work we have been able to impact around 20,000 people in the last 1.5 years across 4 countries: India (Pune, Mumbai, Delhi & Karnataka), Canada (Vancouver Halifax & Toronto), and Uganda and Ghana. We have also conducted 30+ events in the last 6 months for more than 2000 students in Canada to further build skills and confidence among the youth and thus, empower them to become write-off their own story and get the access to role models that guide them to do so.
